Juliana: I work every weekend and usually donâ€™t engage in academic meetings unless necessary. No other personal commitments coming up that could change availability. 
Daniel: No personal commitments. Would prefer weekdays afternoon/evening.
Jason: I work Monday-Friday: 9am-5pm. Work is pretty understanding about school and I will be available to meet most times unless there are mandatory meetings. Other than that, I do not have any personal commitments at this time.
